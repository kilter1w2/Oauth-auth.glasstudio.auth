## üåü Overview

The GLAStudio OAuth system allows you to securely connect your account to third-party applications while maintaining full control over your data and permissions.

### What is OAuth?

OAuth (Open Authorization) is a secure way to give applications access to your account without sharing your password. Think of it like giving a key to a trusted friend - you can always take it back!

### Key Benefits

- ‚úÖ **Secure**: No password sharing required
- ‚úÖ **Controllable**: You decide what data to share
- ‚úÖ **Revocable**: Remove access anytime
- ‚úÖ **Transparent**: See exactly what each app can access
- ‚úÖ **Limited**: Apps only get the permissions you approve

## üöÄ Getting Started

### First Time Setup

1. **Create Your Account**
   - Sign up at `https://yourdomain.com`
   - Verify your email address
   - Set up your profile with avatar and username

2. **Complete Your Profile**
   - Add a profile picture
   - Set your display name
   - Configure privacy settings

3. **Explore Connected Apps**
   - Visit `https://yourdomain.com/user/apps`
   - See all applications connected to your account
   - Review permissions and data access

### Understanding the OAuth Flow

When you connect to a new app, here's what happens:

1. **App Requests Access**: The app asks to connect to your account
2. **You Review Permissions**: You see exactly what the app wants to access
3. **You Approve or Deny**: You decide whether to grant access
4. **App Gets Limited Access**: The app receives only the permissions you approved
5. **You Stay in Control**: You can revoke access anytime

## üì± Managing Connected Apps

### Revoking App Access

#### Why Revoke Access?

#### How to Revoke Access

1. **Navigate to App Details**
   - Go to your connected apps list
   - Click on the app you want to remove

2. **Review Current Access**
   - See what data the app currently has access to
   - Check when it last accessed your data

3. **Revoke Access**
   - Click "Revoke Access" button
   - Confirm your decision
   - The app will immediately lose access

#### What Happens When You Revoke

- ‚úÖ **Immediate Effect**: App loses access instantly
- ‚úÖ **Data Protection**: App can no longer access your data
- ‚úÖ **Token Invalidation**: All access tokens are invalidated
- ‚úÖ **Notification**: App is notified of the revocation
- ‚úÖ **Reversible**: You can always reconnect later

### Reconnecting to Apps

If you revoke access and want to reconnect:

1. **Visit the App**: Go to the app's website
2. **Initiate Connection**: Click "Connect with GLAStudio"
3. **Review Permissions**: See what the app wants to access
4. **Approve**: Grant the permissions you're comfortable with

## üîê Understanding Permissions

### Common Permission Types

#### Profile Permissions
- **Basic Profile**: Name, username, avatar
- **Email Address**: Your email for account purposes
- **Profile Picture**: Your avatar image

#### Data Access Permissions
- **Read Access**: App can view your data
- **Write Access**: App can modify your data
- **Delete Access**: App can remove your data

#### Scope Descriptions

| Scope | Description | What the app can do |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| `profile` | Basic profile information | View your name, username, and avatar |
| `email` | Email address | Access your email for account purposes |
| `read` | Read data | View your information |
| `write` | Write data | Modify your information |
| `delete` | Delete data | Remove your information |

### Permission Levels

#### Low Risk Permissions
- **Profile Access**: Basic information like name and avatar
- **Email Access**: Email address for account purposes
- **Read-Only Access**: View data without modification

#### Medium Risk Permissions
- **Write Access**: Ability to modify your data
- **Extended Profile**: Additional profile information
- **Activity Access**: View your activity history

#### High Risk Permissions
- **Delete Access**: Ability to remove your data
- **Full Access**: Complete access to your account
- **Admin Access**: Administrative privileges

### Best Practices for Permissions

1. **Review Before Approving**
   - Read permission descriptions carefully
   - Understand what data the app will access
   - Consider if the app really needs these permissions

2. **Start with Minimum Permissions**
   - Grant only what's necessary
   - You can always add more permissions later
   - Start with read-only access when possible

3. **Regular Permission Reviews**
   - Periodically review your connected apps
   - Remove apps you no longer use
   - Check if apps still need their current permissions

## ‚ùì FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: What is OAuth and why should I use it?**
A: OAuth is a secure way to connect your account to apps without sharing your password. It's safer and gives you more control over your data.

**Q: Is it safe to connect my account to apps?**
A: Yes, when done through our OAuth system. You control what data apps can access, and you can revoke access anytime.

**Q: Can apps see my password?**
A: No! Apps never see your password. They only get a special access token that you can revoke anytime.

### Privacy Questions

**Q: What data do apps have access to?**
A: Only the data you explicitly approve. You'll see exactly what each app wants to access before you approve it.
